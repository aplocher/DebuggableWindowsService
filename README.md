DebuggableWindowsService
========================

Based on the standard Visual Studio 2013 Windows Service project, developers can utilize this project to debug the Windows Service in multiple ways: a) a thin debuggable console app wrapper that can be launched directly from Visual Studio, or b) a command line argument that can be passed into the service directly to debug the service as a Windows Service (native).
